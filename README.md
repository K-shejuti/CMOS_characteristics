# CMOS_characteristics
This project has only one motive; that is to experiment with working of a Mosfet and understanding all the parameters involved with it. The design will utilise the models that are present under the skywater 130nm pdk and various open source tools such as Xschem, NGSPICE , Netgen, etc.
